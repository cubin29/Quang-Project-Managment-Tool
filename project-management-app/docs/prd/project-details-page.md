## üìä Analytics (Future Phase)
- % of tasks on-time vs delayed
- Risk resolution rate
- Average task completion time
- Active CRs count per project

## üìå Notes
- All views must be responsive.
- All CRUD actions require optimistic UI & success/error feedback.
- Error states should be handled gracefully (e.g., empty states, load failures).

---

## üß™ Next Steps
- Finalize data structure and sync with backend.
- Define frontend components based on views (Kanban, Gantt, Table).
- Start MVP sprint planning with dev team.
